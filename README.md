# Educational-Data-PCA-Analysis

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to an educational dataset containing detailed information on colleges and universities across the United States. The goal is to perform dimensionality reduction to uncover underlying patterns and relationships between institutional characteristics such as admissions, faculty, expenses, and graduation rates.

## 💡 Project Overview

The dataset includes information such as student enrollment, acceptance rates, financial expenditures, faculty qualifications, and academic performance metrics. Through PCA, the analysis aims to:

Reduce the number of correlated variables into key components

Identify the most influential factors driving institutional variation

Visualize data structure for better interpretation and insight extraction

## 🧩 Dataset Features

Some of the main variables analyzed include:

Number of applications received, accepted, and enrolled

Percentage of top-performing students admitted

Faculty qualifications (Ph.D. and terminal degrees)

Student–faculty ratio and alumni donation percentage

Expenditures, tuition, and graduation rates

## ⚙️ Techniques Used

Data preprocessing and standardization

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations

Insight interpretation from principal components
